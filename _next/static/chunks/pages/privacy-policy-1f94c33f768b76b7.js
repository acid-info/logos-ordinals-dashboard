We limit the collection and processing of personal data from your use of the Website\n\n\nWe aim to limit the collection and processing of personal data from users of the Website. We only collect and process certain personal data for specific purposes and where we have the legal basis to do so under applicable privacy legislation. We will not collect or process any personal data that we don’t need and where we do store any personal data, we will only store it for the least amount of time needed for the indicated purpose. \n\n\nIn this regard, the information requested and received by us will be used for, but not limited to:\n\n\n1. Providing you with access to certain functionalities or features of the Website;\n2. The administration of XP that you might receive; and/or\n3. Any other action necessary to fulfil our obligations under the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.\n\n\nCurrently, we collect and process the following personal data from your use of the Website:\n\n1. The user’s wallet address (also known as a wallet address);\n2. The XP amount associated with the user’s connected wallet address, which is updated based on specific interactions with the Website;\n3. The ‘OP number’ associated with the digital token held by a user’s connected wallet address;\n4. Display name, should a user choose to set one.\n\nIn respect of the administration of XP (as defined in the Terms of Use), we process various pieces of information related to your activities, some of which may constitute personal data, but could still be used to infer identifying details based on your behaviour. These activities include off-chain interactions. Currently, off-chain activities stored in our database include:\n\n\n1. Connecting their wallet for the first time;\n2. Details of a user’s staking actions performed within the Dashboard;\n3. A user making a referral (a short, randomly generated code);\n4. Using a referral link from another user.\n\nThe aforementioned activities may generate experience points (XP), which are associated with a user’s connected wallet address along with the timestamp and session ID of each activity.\n\nYour personal data will be processed by us in our database as long as it complies with applicable privacy legislation regarding each type of information. We can only use this personal data for any of the purposes described in this privacy policy.\n\n<br />\n\n## 3.

To the extent you interact with such third party content or features, their respective privacy policies will apply. \n\n<br />\n\n## 5. Security measures we take in respect of the Website\n\nAs a general approach, we take data security seriously and we have implemented a variety of security measures on the Website to maintain the safety of your personal data when you submit such information to us. \n\n<br />\n\n## 6.

This means that personal data will only be processed in countries or by parties that provide an adequate level of protection as deemed by Switzerland or the European Commission.
